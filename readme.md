- I haven't made this "very OOP" (yet). We may end up excluding "Endpoint" has fastapi already provides classes and stuff to use.
    - Anything in the `routers` folder (assuming it's been written correctly) will be treated as an endpoint. This makes things nice and modular. You can have multiple endpoints in each file too depending on how you conceptualise stuff.
- I am using a very strict and implicit way of writing this. Keep that in mind.
